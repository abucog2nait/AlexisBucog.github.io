		<h2>Business Analyst/Game Development Capstone 2020</h2>
		<p>As one of the two lead Business Analyst, my role was to communicate with to identify the requirements needed for the developers to design and program games. In this project, the Agile methodology was implemented for this project. My job as a BA was to lead and teach the developers on how to approach this business process. I did this by creating user stories and placing them in the backlog. I had to define the acceptance criteria and definition of done to conduct testing at the end of every sprint. In addition, I had to facilitate daily stand-ups, sprint planning meetings, sprint review meetings, backlog refinement meetings, and sprint retrospective meetings. I completed BA deliverables such as documenting backlog(s) then breaking it down into tasks for each group on a Kanban board and analyzing the risk by conducting a risk analysis assessment for each project.</p>

		<h2>Web Application</h2>
		<img class="web" src="img/webappproject.jpg" alt="Web Application">
		<p>A Razor web application form that utilizes CRUD and allows the user to search for an address in the database.</p>
		<p>The CRUD â€“ StarTED is a web application that uses Razor (ASP.NET Framework), StarTED database, and possesses CRUD (Add, Update, Delete). The form allows the user to enter a partial address (or full address), which will then update the dropdown menu below the form. The drop-down menu contains a list of results that relates to the partial address entered by the user. Once the user selects the address of choice another form will be brought up. This form will include the details of the address selected. In addition to this form, the CRUD functions will be located on the bottom. The user has the option to add or remove extra details and update the details of the address, remove the address from the database, and add a new address to the database.</p>
